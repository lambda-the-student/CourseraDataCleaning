# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This dataset has been created to fulfill the requirements of the 
Getting and Cleaning Data Course from Coursera.

Based on [data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)
provided by course instructors which is, in turn, has been derived from
[human activity data](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)
collected using smartphones.

## Dataset files

* README.md: this file;

* run_analysis.R: source data transformation script;

* CodeBook.md: metainformation about data file and details of transformation 
  procedure;

* ms-aggregate.txt: data file itself (not available from GitHub, uploaded 
  directly to Coursera grading infrastructure).
 
## Notes

According to project instructions,

> 3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any 
  transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called 
  CodeBook.md.

details about steps performed to produce the data set should be placed into
the CodeBook.md. This contradicts with submission instructions which specify
putting them in README, but codebook seems be more appropriate place to keep
things together.
